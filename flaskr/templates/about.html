<h3>About this Wiki</h3>

<p>This wiki Museum stands as a home base for building a music community.<br>
Here we want to create an ecyclopedia of our users music interests so that they<br>
detemine what sounds define them. Any user is able to set up what is essentially<br>
a sub-wikipedia describing their music interests and it begins with our page authors.
